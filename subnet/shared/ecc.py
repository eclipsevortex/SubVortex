    Compute a SHA3-256 hash of the input data and return its integer representation.

    The function handles both byte-like and non-byte-like inputs by converting non-byte inputs to

    Parameters:
    - data (bytes | bytearray | object): Data to be hashed.

    Returns:
    - int: Integer representation of the SHA3-256 hash of the input data.

    Raises:
