    Sets the miner's weights on the Bittensor network.

    This function assigns a weight of 1 to the current miner (identified by its UID) and
    a weight of 0 to all other peers in the network. The weights determine the trust level
    the miner assigns to other nodes on the network.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Queries the Bittensor network for the total number of peers.
    2. Sets a weight vector with a value of 1 for the current miner and 0 for all other peers.
    3. Updates these weights on the Bittensor network using the `set_weights` method of the subtensor.
    4. Optionally logs the weight-setting operation to Weights & Biases (wandb) for monitoring.

    Args:
        subtensor (btcs.Subtensor): The Bittensor object managing the blockchain connection.
        wallet (btw.Wallet): The miner's wallet holding cryptographic information.
        netuid (int): The unique identifier for the chain subnet.
        uids (torch.Tensor): miners UIDs on the network.
        weights (torch.Tensor): weights to sent for UIDs on the network.
        metagraph (btcm.Metagraph): Bittensor metagraph.
        wandb_on (bool, optional): Flag to determine if logging to Weights & Biases is enabled. Defaults to False.
        wait_for_inclusion (bool, optional): Wether to wait for the extrinsic to enter a block.
        wait_for_finalization (bool, optional): Wether to wait for the extrinsic to be finalized on the chain.

    Returns:
        success (bool):
            flag is true if extrinsic was finalized or uncluded in the block.
            If we did not wait for finalization / inclusion, the response is true.
        message (str):
            message returned by the chain.

    Raises:
        Exception: If there's an error while setting weights, the exception is logged for diagnosis.
