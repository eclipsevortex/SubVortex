> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Architecture Notice**  
> The Miner Redis currently supports only **x86_64 (amd64)** servers.  
> `arm64` support is not yet available but is a work in progress.

# Installation

Before getting started, you need to create an .env file with the correct configuration. To generate it, run

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Then, open `.env` in a text editor and update it with your settings.

## As process <a id="installation-as-process"></a>

> **IMPORTANT** <br />
> Before starting, be sure pm2 is installed if you decide to run the Miner Redis in a process, see [pm2 installation](../../../scripts/process/README.md)

To setup the Miner Redis, you can run

```bash
./subvortex/miner/redis/deployment/process/redis_process_setup.sh
```

To start the Miner Redis, you can run

```bash
./subvortex/miner/redis/deployment/process/redis_process_start.sh
```

To check the Miner Redis is up and running, you can run

```bash
pm2 log subvortex-miner-redis
```

You should see something like

```bash

```

## As service <a id="installation-as-service"></a>

To setup the Miner Redis, you can run

```bash
./subvortex/miner/redis/deployment/service/redis_service_setup.sh
```

To start the Miner Redis, you can run

```bash
./subvortex/miner/redis/deployment/service/redis_service_start.sh
```

To check the Miner Redis is up and running, you can run

```bash
systemctl status subvortex-miner-redis
```

You should see something like

```bash
‚óè subvortex-miner-redis.service - SubVortex Miner Redis
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/subvortex-miner-redis.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Mon 2025-05-05 17:25:57 BST; 4s ago

```

If you have these kind of logs

```bash
‚öôÔ∏è  Setting up for 'process' mode...
üîß Setting up subvortex-miner-redis...
üöÄ Installing Redis server if not already installed...
‚úÖ redis-server already installed.
üìÇ Preparing redis directory...
‚úÖ No redis binary or config changes detected ‚Äî skipping redis.conf update.
üîê Redis password already up-to-date ‚Äî no changes made.

üö´ Masking default redis-server systemd service...
üìÅ Ensuring Redis data directory exists: /var/lib/redis

```

With a lot of `no changed detected`, you can remove the checksums in order to reinstall everything from scratch

```bash
rm -rf /var/tmp/subvortex.checksums/*
```

## As docker container <a id="installation-as-container"></a>

> **IMPORTANT** <br />
> Before starting, be sure docker is installed if you decide to run the Miner Redis as docker container, see [docker installation](../../scripts/docker/README.md)

If you are not using the Auto Upgrader, you have to prefix all these commands by

```bash
export SUBVORTEX_FLOATTING_FLAG=latest
```

For testnet, you can use `latest` (release) or `stable` (release candidate).

To build the Miner Redis, you can run

```bash
./subvortex/miner/redis/deployment/docker/redis_docker_setup.sh
```

To start the Miner Redis, you can run

```bash
./subvortex/miner/redis/deployment/docker/redis_docker_start.sh
```

To check the Miner Redis is up and running, you can run

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see a container named `subvortex-miner-redis`.

# Uninstall

## As process <a id="uninstall-as-process"></a>

To uninstall the Miner Redis, you can run

```bash
./subvortex/miner/redis/deployment/process/redis_process_teardown.sh
```

To check the Miner Redis has been uninstalled, you can run

```bash
pm2 list
```

You should not see any process named `subvortex-miner-redis`.

## As service <a id="uninstall-as-service"></a>

To uninstall the Miner Redis, you can run

```bash
./subvortex/miner/redis/deployment/service/redis_service_teardown.sh
```

To check the Miner Redis has been uninstalled, you can run

```

You should see something like

```bash
Unit subvortex-miner-redis.service could not be found.
```

## As docker container <a id="uninstall-as-container"></a>
